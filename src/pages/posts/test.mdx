# Hello, World!

I'm Ash Entwisle. Im a 1'st year Computer Science student at the University of Hull. 
I like doing backend development and exploring new languages, frameworks and technologies. 
I also love tinkering with linux. 
I have now been using linux for about 3 years and I have been daily driving it for about 2 years.
I currently run Arch *(btw)* on my home machine with the hyprland window manager, 
It was a bit of a pain to set up but it was well worth it.

I have always been drawn to interesting and unique projects that aim to change your workflow. 
One of these is [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/), a modal text editor based off of kakoune. 
It has been my main editor for about 3 months *(as of march 2023)* and I have been loving it.
The learning curve is extremely steep, but I always love a challenge.
