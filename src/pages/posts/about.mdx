# Hello, World!

I'm Ash!<sub>*(she/they)*</sub> A very *✨🏳️‍⚧️ queer 🏳️‍⚧️✨* 1st year Comp-Sci student

I'm currently learning rust and c# and tinkering with astro to create simple websites.
I like messing around with new languages, frameworks and tools 
and I'm always looking for new things to try.
